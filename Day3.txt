React flow and structure

In public folder,we have html file,also called SPA(single page application),(loads only once)
manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a user's mobile device or desktop. 
in package.json, along with react-dom and react, we also get read-scripts which is responsible for loading index.js in html file

--> vite
while making new component in src (vite) , component file should be jsx ,also should start with capital letter(not the file name, but function that we are exporting, better practice to use file name to be capital too)
we can return only single element from component, so we can wrap all the lements to be sent in a div and return that div
(eg. function Day3(){
        return(
            <div>
                <h1></h1>
                <p></p>
                ....
            </div>
        )
    };
    export default Day3

    we can use 
    return(
        <h1></h1>
        <p></p>
    )
)

it became a common problem so insted of div we can simple use empty brackets (<> </>) also called fragment


--> create-react-app

component file need not be jsx (if html is getting returned, use jsx, if only java code is returned, you can use js. but in vite, both should be jsx)
function name should be capital (better to use file name capital too)
use fragments (cant return more than 1 element)
